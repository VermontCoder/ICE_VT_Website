# Project: ICE Tours VT

This project is a static website designed to inform the public about ICE Tours VT.

## What (Architecture and Structure)

*   **Frontend:** Static Website using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.
*   **General Page Layout:** All pages (except index.html) should have a header with a miniature version of the `img/primary_logo.png` and the words "ICE Tours VT" on it. There should be navigation links entitled "About ICE in VT", "Schedule" and "Contact" linking to the appropriate pages. Clicking on the miniaturized logo should link to `index2.html`.
*   **Art Assets:** Available art assets to be used on the site are in the "img" folder. These can be cropped or other images downloaded as appropriate to emphasize the message.
*   **Pages:**
    -   `index.html`: "Coming Soon" landing page. Has no header/navigation. Shows the logo, "Coming Soon" heading, and brief placeholder text.
    -   `index2.html`: Full homepage. Prominently features the ICE Tours VT logo located at `img/primary_logo.png`. Contains a few sentences describing the website's purpose and ends with "Come join us on a tour!" Header logo links to this page.
    -   `about_ice_in_vt.html`: Should contain text and images. To create this text, summarize the document in `support_info/factsheet.pdf`. **important** do NOT link to this file anywhere on the site or mention it via text.
    -   `schedule.html`: This page should be a three column table with headers of "Date", "Time", and "Start Location". There should only be one row with "TBD" in all 3 cols.
    -   `contact.html`: This page should feature a contact page. However do not construct the contact form. Instead put this HTML for a contact page:

        <iframe class="airtable-embed" src="https://airtable.com/embed/app1OEIXVKDqP2BEu/pagJO3cM36OESsWxq/form" frameborder="0" onmousewheel="" width="100%" height="533" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

    

## Why (Purpose and Goals)

ICE Tours VT is an organization which hosts tours of ICE facilities in the Burlington, Vermont area. The purpose of the organization is
to show the public what ICE is doing and the infrastructure required to accomplish their nefarious goals. However, the tours
they host are joking versions of normal tourbus tours such as the ones that can be found in Los Angeles or New York. That is 
because ICE is bad and going on a tourist tour of their facilities is a bit strange and ridiculous.

The tone of the website should be upbeat and cheerful but also not hide the fact that these facilities are actors in state dominance of the populace.

## Coding Standards & Guardrails

*   **Code Style:** Please use a separate "styles.css" for all css.
