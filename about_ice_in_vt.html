                    Welcome, tour enthusiasts! You might be surprised to learn that little ol' Vermont is
                    home to not one, but <strong>two</strong> nationally significant ICE facilities. That's right &mdash;
                    tucked away in Williston, just a stone's throw from Burlington, are major hubs of federal
                    immigration enforcement operations. Let's take a peek at what's happening in our own backyard!

                        Our first tour stop is this impressive 74,320 square foot facility staffed by
                        approximately 60 ICE personnel. This building houses some fascinating operations:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC)</strong> &mdash; A 24/7/365 operation that never sleeps!</li>
                        <li><strong>Homeland Security Investigations Tip Line (HSITL)</strong> &mdash; Fun fact: This is the nation's <em>only</em> tip line processing center. Every tip submitted online or by phone across the entire country comes right here to Vermont!</li>
