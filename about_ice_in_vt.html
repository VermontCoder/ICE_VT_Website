            <h1>About ICE in Vermont</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome, tour enthusiasts! You might be surprised to learn that little ol' Vermont is home to not one, but <strong>two</strong> nationally significant ICE facilities. That's right - tucked away in Williston, just a stone's throw from Burlington, are major hubs of federal immigration enforcement operations. Let's take a peek at what's happening in our own backyard!
            </p>

            <div class="facility-card">
                <h3>Stop #1: 188 Harvest Lane, Williston</h3>

                <p>
                    Our first tour stop is this impressive 74,320 square foot facility staffed by approximately 60 ICE personnel. This building houses some fascinating operations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC)</strong> - A 24/7/365 operation that never sleeps!</li>
                    <li><strong>Homeland Security Investigations Tip Line (HSITL)</strong> - Fun fact: This is the nation's <em>only</em> tip line processing center. Every tip submitted online or by phone across the entire country comes right here to Vermont!</li>
                    <li><strong>National Crime Information Center</strong> - A data center managing records for approximately 340,000 individuals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The facility is owned by Easterly Government Properties, Inc. and has a lease running through 2031. They're planning to add 100 more employees - business is booming!

                    <li><strong>National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center (NCATC)</strong> - One of only <em>two</em> such facilities in the entire country! The other is way out in Santa Ana, California.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impressive Numbers</strong> - In fiscal year 2023 alone, this facility investigated 4.6 million individuals. That's a lot of investigating!</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Monitoring</strong> - A team of contractors dedicated to monitoring Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube</li>
                    <li><strong>Commercial Databases</strong> - Access to tools like LexisNexis Accurint and Thomson Reuters CLEAR for comprehensive background searches</li>

                    <li><strong>Advanced Surveillance Tech</strong> - Contracts with companies providing sophisticated phone surveillance capabilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                These aren't your typical government office buildings. These facilities represent significant infrastructure for federal surveillance and immigration enforcement that affects communities nationwide - all operating quietly in Vermont. Our tours help shine a light on these operations so that Vermonters can see for themselves what's happening in their community.
            </p>
